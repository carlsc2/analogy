      <zh-speak>後英式搖滾（英语：Post-Britpop）是英式另类摇滚下的一種音樂類型。此類型的音樂在英伦摇滚沒落後崛起，並成為21世紀的主流音樂之一。這些樂團受到了果漿樂團、绿洲乐队和布勒等樂團的啟發，但相較於英倫搖滾，他們的歌詞較少強調英國國內的觀點，反而融入了美式搖滾、独立摇滚和實驗音樂的元素。电台司令和神韻合唱團等樂團在英倫搖滾尚未衰退之前就已獲得了些許成功，但在退潮之後才開始成為英國音樂的主流。隨著時間的演進，愈來愈多樂團參與後英式搖滾的行列，例如特拉维斯、立體音響樂隊和飼養員等樂團。其中，酷玩樂團相較於先於他們的後英式搖滾樂團，在國際上獲得了更大的成功，甚至進而成為2000年代初最成功的樂團之一。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>巴洛克流行（英语：Baroque pop）、巴洛克摇滚或英格兰巴洛克是一个流行搖滾的子类型，于1960年代诞生于美国和英国，融合了流行摇滚、古典音乐、管弦乐流行和巴洛克音乐。该流派在1960年代晚期达到巅峰，常规性地创作这种音乐的乐队有：披头士乐队、海滩男孩、滚石乐队、普洛柯哈伦等。1970年代，巴洛克流行渐渐失去主流影响力，一部分原因是朋克搖滾、迪斯科和硬摇滚的风靡。在古典音乐领域，巴洛克音乐指约1600年至1750年间欧洲的艺术音乐，著名的作曲家为巴赫与维瓦尔第等。巴洛克流行不如同时期的摇滚乐狂野奔放，商业化程度较低，更严肃成熟。它采用在流行乐中少见的乐器如弦乐器、圆号、大鍵琴、風琴等。常见的元素也包括多层旋律、突出的和声与精巧的制作。和同样采用管弦乐编曲的前卫摇滚相比，巴洛克流行总体来说歌曲结构较简单，接近标准流行乐；歌词也更主流，不像晚期的前卫摇滚大多有抽象的歌词。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes, though it was later repurposed to refer to a series of late 1980s British alternative rock bands that drew from earlier influences to create a more ambient but still melodic form of pop music.</speak>
      <zh-speak>太空摇滚是摇滚乐的一个分支，这个词原本是指20世纪70年代早期，主要是英国的一些前卫和迷幻摇滚乐队，如Hawkwind的和Pink Floyd，缓慢冗长的器乐段落、占主导地位的电子乐器、合成器，吉他实验作品和科幻或天文主题是它的风格，尽管它后来被用于形容一系列20世纪80年代末英国另类摇滚乐队，这些乐队受早期太空摇滚的影响，创造一种更加氛围话、但仍然旋律优美的流行音乐形式。这个词在21世纪复兴了，代表乐队有The Flowers of Hell、Comets on Fire、Flotation Toy Warning和God Is an Astronaut等。</zh-speak>

It was one of their lowest-charting singles on the UK singles chart, peaking at #55 but was more successful in Ireland and New-Zealand, reaching the Top 20.Allmusic cited the song as an example of "when U2 marry the message, melody, and sound together... the results are thoroughly impressive," while Pitchfork said the song "displays some musical dynamism, but its Latin-language chorus tempers its anthemic qualities."</speak>

The song received moderate airplay on album-oriented rock radio, appearing on the Billboard Top Tracks chart for 14 weeks, peaking at number 27. The song was also a prominent concert number during Springsteen's 1984-85 Born in the U.S.A. Tour.Like Prince's "Little Red Corvette", "Pink Cadillac" follows the tradition of the Wilson Pickett R&amp;B classic "Mustang Sally" in using automobile travel as a metaphor for sexual activity, particularly as sung by Springsteen as the lyric: "I love you for your pink Cadillac" was originally a veiled pudendal reference.</speak>

      <speak>A fleet or naval fleet is a large formation of warships, and the largest formation in any navy.</speak>
      <zh-speak>海军舰队（Naval fleet）是海军的高级作战兵力集团，有较固定的作战水域，担负某一战略方向海上作战任务的海军战略战役集团；通常是海军中最高级别的建制单位。海军舰队一般都以作战海区的名字命名的，但美国海军也用数字来为海军舰队命名。海军舰队包括水面舰艇、潜艇、海軍航空兵、海軍陸戰隊、岸防兵以及各种勤务保障部队等兵种部队，并设有舰队陸岸單位。海军舰队的指挥官，传统上军衔是海军上将，战时甚至是海军元帥或海军五星上將。但很多海军舰队由于规模较小，是由海军中将甚至是海军少将指挥的。传统上，海军舰队由分舰队（Squadron）组成。分舰队有自己的指挥官。分舰队分为若干个支队（Division）。在風帆時代，舰队中的舰只按照在战斗线上的位置被划分到前锋分舰队、中部分舰队、后部分舰队，分别由海军中将、海军上将、海军少将担任指挥官。战舰开始使用蒸汽机的近现代时期，分舰队大多都由同类型的战舰组成，比如战列舰分舰队或巡洋舰分舰队。因此按作战任务临时编组多种类型舰船的兵力集团成为特混舰队。现代海军舰队的有的设有下属的舰队，如美國海軍太平洋艦隊下属第三艦隊与第七艦隊；有的下设海军基地，如中国人民解放军海军、苏联海军；有的设有区舰队、分舰队或按任务编组的特混舰队。更低层级的舰艇编制单位有总队、支队、大队、中队、分队、小队等。海军舰队受海军总部领导。有的国家海军舰队在作战上归战区司令部指挥。例如，美国陆海空军军事行动受各个战区的联合作战司令部指挥，部署在印度洋波斯湾的美国海军舰艇的作战行动受美国中央司令部（USCENTCOM）指挥，在印度洋的美国海军第五艦隊无作战指挥权。中国人民解放军海军與南越海軍在1974年爆發的西沙海战，也是由广州军区直接指挥参战舰艇编队的海上指挥所，南海艦隊、榆林海军基地都没有指挥权。很多国家的海軍只拥有一个舰队，所以在这些国家，“艦隊”往往与“海军”同义。例如，英國皇家海軍设有「皇家海軍艦隊」，下辖第1、第2、第3分艦隊及潜艇舰队等，因此在英国“fleet”一词常常指代英國海軍。临时性的多國联合艦隊在海軍歷史上很常见。比如1571年，在勒班陀战役中几个国家组成了神圣同盟舰队。在现代，北约在很多次行动中组织多國聯合艦隊，比如说在2001年在地中海舉辦的「積極行動」（Operation Active Endeavour）。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>最尊贵的巴斯勋章（The Most Honourable Order of the Bath，旧称最尊贵的巴斯军事勋章），由乔治一世在1725年5月18日设立。巴斯一名来自于中世纪时代，册封骑士的其中一种仪式 - 沐浴，象征着净化。以这种方式册封的骑士称为“沐浴骑士”，音译为“巴斯骑士”。乔治一世为这些骑士设立了巴斯骑士团，但他本人并非巴斯骑士，因为巴斯骑士此前并非骑士团，管理依据一系列的规定进行，在巴斯骑士出现空缺时会选择人选替补。巴斯勋章分为三等：爵级大十字勋章（Knight/Dame Grand Cross，GCB）爵级司令勋章（Knight/Dame Commander，KCB/DCB）三等勋章（Companion，CB）巴斯勋章分为民事或军事两类。在1815年之前，巴斯勋章只有一种等级，巴斯勛爵士（Knight Companion，KB），现在已经废除。获勋者通常是高级军官或高级公务员。并非英女皇子民的获勋者是骑士团的荣誉成员。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Lester Russel Brown .Brown emphasizes the geopolitical effects of fast-rising grain prices, noting that "the biggest threat to global stability is the potential for food crises in poor countries," and one that could "bring down civilization." In Foreign Policy magazine, he describes how the "new geopolitics of food" has, in 2011, already begun to contribute to revolutions and upheaval in various countries.The recipient of 26 honorary degrees and a MacArthur Fellowship, Brown has been described by the Washington Post as "one of the world's most influential thinkers." As early as 1978, in his book The Twenty-Ninth Day, he was already warning of "the various dangers arising out of our manhandling of nature...by overfishing the oceans, stripping the forests, turning land into desert." In 1986, the Library of Congress requested his personal papers noting that his writings “have already strongly affected thinking about problems of world population and resources,” while president Bill Clinton has suggested that "we should all heed his advice." In 2003 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.In the mid-1970s, Brown helped pioneer the concept of sustainable development, during a career that started with farming.</speak>

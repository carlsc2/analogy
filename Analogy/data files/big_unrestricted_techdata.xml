      <zh-speak>BigTable是一種壓縮的、高效能的、高可擴展性的，基于Google檔案系統（Google File System，GFS）的数据存储系统，用於儲存大规模結構化数据，適用於雲端計算。BigTable發展於2004年，現今已成為Google的應用程式。像是MapReduce就常透過BigTable來儲存或更改資料，其他還有Google Reader、Google Maps、Google Book Search、"My Search History"、Google Earth、Blogger.com、Google Code hosting、Orkut、YouTube以及Gmail等。Google自行發展出特別的巨型資料庫的原因，自然是效能的問題。BigTable不是传统的关系型数据库，不支援JOIN这样的SQL語法，BigTable更像今日的NoSQL的Table-oriented，优势在于扩展性和性能。BigTable的Table資料結構包括row key、col key和timestamp，其中row key用於儲存倒轉的URL，例如www.google.com必須改成com.google.www。BigTable使用大量的Table，在Table之下還有Tablet。每一個Tablets大概有100-200MB，每台机器有100個左右的Tablets。所謂的Table是屬於immutable的SSTables，也就是存储方式不可修改。另外Table還必須進行壓縮，其壓縮又分成table的壓縮或系統的壓縮。客户端有一指向META0的Tablets的指標，METAO tablets保儲所有的META1的tablets的資料記錄。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>并发计算（英语：Concurrent computing，或譯為並行處理、共時計算），是一種程式計算的形式，在系統中，至少有兩個以上的計算在同時運作，計算結果可能同時發生。用來實作並行系統（Concurrent system）的程式語言與各種演算法，統稱為並行計算。並行程式通常被設計為互動式的運算過程，因為它的運算過程是不確定的，在設計上的難度較高。設計並行程式最大的挑戰，在於確保不同運算執行步驟間的互動或是通訊，能以正確的順序進行，同時，也要確保在不同執行步驟間共享的資源，能夠正確被存取。在這個領域的先驅人物有艾兹赫尔·戴克斯特拉、東尼·霍爾與泊·派克·漢森等人。</zh-speak>

Although for legal reasons FreeBSD cannot use the Unix trademark, it is a direct descendant of BSD, which was historically also called "BSD Unix" or "Berkeley Unix". The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993, and today FreeBSD is the most widely used open-source BSD distribution, accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed systems running open-source BSD derivatives.FreeBSD has similarities with Linux, with two major differences in scope and licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete operating system, i.e. the project delivers kernel, device drivers, userland utilities and documentation, as opposed to Linux delivering a kernel and drivers only and relying on third-parties for system software; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license as opposed to the copyleft GPL.The FreeBSD project includes a security team overseeing all software shipped in the base distribution.</speak>

      <zh-speak>Oberon，一種程式語言，由是Pascal之父尼克勞斯·維爾特设计。最初是作为Oberon项目的一部分出现的。在设计了Pascal，Modula，Modula-2之后，Wirth发现程序语言过分复杂精微了，提供了很多很少用或者基本不用的抽象机制，而Oberon是最简化的一次尝试。它设计的非常小，一页纸就能用EBNF写下它的文法。最早的Oberon全编译器才4000多行代码。现在Oberon已经发展到Oberon-2，Oberon-07。Oberon是一个以安全为目标的语言，它包括数组边界检查，垃圾回收以及型別安全检查。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of subroutines, block structures and for and while loops—in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the goto statement which could lead to "spaghetti code" which is difficult both to follow and to maintain.It emerged in the 1960s—particularly from a famous letter, Go To Statement Considered Harmful.—and was bolstered theoretically by the structured program theorem, and practically by the emergence of languages such as ALGOL with suitably rich control structures.</speak>
      <zh-speak>結構化程式設計（英语：Structured programming），一種編程典範。它採用子程序、程式碼區塊、for迴圈以及while迴圈等結構，來取代傳統的 goto。希望藉此來改善计算机程序的明晰性、品質以及開發時間，並且避免寫出麵條式代碼。結構化程式設計在1960年代開始發展，科拉多·伯姆及朱塞佩·賈可皮尼（Giuseppe Jacopini）於1966年5月在《Communications of the ACM》期刊發表論文，說明任何一個有goto指令的程式，可以改為完全不使用goto指令的程式，後來艾兹赫尔·戴克斯特拉在1968年也提出著名的論文《GOTO陳述有害論》（Go To Statement Considered Harmful），，因此結構化程式設計開始盛行，此概念理論上可以由結構化程式理論所證明，而在實務上，當時也有像ALGOL一樣，有豐富控制結構的程式語言來實現結構化程式設計。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>《Everlasting Summer》（俄語：Бесконечное лето，羅馬化：Beskonechnoe leto）是一款视觉小说遊戲，由俄羅斯蘇維埃遊戲工作室（Soviet Games）製作。名稱來自劇情中無限循環的夏令營。故事劇情是一名隱蔽人士謝米揚於21世纪的某日莫名其妙地时间旅行回到苏联1980年代，參加了苏联少先队的夏令營，並結識了數名女性人物的戀愛遊戲。遊戲於2013年12月發行俄語版本，並於2014年11月於Steam發行英語版本。本遊戲因為其獨特的蘇聯題材，並且為免費的限制級遊戲，因而引起關注。雖然遊戲為限制級美少女遊戲，但限制級的內容在上架至Steam前，已先移除；不過也有正規的方法啟動這些內容。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>《極速快感：進化世代》（英语：Need for Speed: Shift）为极品飞车系列转变制作思路后的第一批作品之一，预计于2009年9月22日在北美首发。2008年发售的《极品飞车：无间风云》的销量远逊于预期，致使EA对该系列的全平台战略做出了调整，改为针对不同平台推出不同的作品，重振极品飞车系列的辉煌。《极品飞车：進化世代》便是专门针对核心平台的传统赛车作品，对应PC、Playstation 3、Xbox360、PSP、iPhone OS五个平台。该作的主要卖点为精致细腻的画面以及真實刺激的驾驶体验。在2009年发售的三款极品飞车作品：《极品飞车：絕影狂飆》、《極速快感Online》、《极品飞车：進化世代》中，本作是最能体现系列传统的作品。EA在2002年的《极品飞车：闪电追踪2》後再沒有收錄法拉利，直到2010年，EA再度取得法拉利授權，將會推出《极品飞车：進化世代》法拉利更新程式：Ferrari Racing Series（法拉利赛车系列），但僅限於Xbox版本，且要花上10美元購買。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>《The Room》是一款由英國遊戲公司Fireproof Games開發，Fireproof Studios發佈的2012年益智游戏。此遊戲的iOS版本於2012年9月19日發佈，而Android版本則於2013年3月23日發佈。以往台灣遊戲論壇多將其翻譯為「密室空間」，中國內地則普遍稱呼為「未上鎖的房間」。2015年Chorus Worldwide所發行亞洲版的中文介面裡，在英文遊戲名稱上方加入中文「未上鎖的房間」。在此遊戲中，玩家需要解除一系列設有機關的奇怪盒子。玩家需要解除盒子上的多個鎖，並完成盒子上的多個謎題，才能打開盒子以取出內裡的另一個盒子。此遊戲的動畫數量不少，其中包括環視盒子、轉動鑰匙、激活開關等。隨著遊戲發展，玩家會逐漸發現盒子與柏拉圖五元素假設中的第五種立體，正十二面體有關。此遊戲獲得了正面的評價，其中的iOS版本更獲得數項獎項。此遊戲至今已售出逾100萬套遊戲，致使Fireproof Games開發此遊戲的續作。遊戲續作The Room Two於2013年12月12日正式發佈。2014年12月傳出即將於翌年推出亞洲版遊戲的消息，由獨立遊戲發行商Chorus Worldwide代理發行，並於2015年6月16日正式發佈亞洲版的iOS版本。而遊戲的第三部作品預計於2015年夏天上市。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>Apache Spark是一個開源叢集運算框架，最初是由加州大學柏克萊分校AMPLab所開發。相對於Hadoop的MapReduce會在執行完工作後將中介資料存放到磁碟中，Spark使用了記憶體內運算技術，能在資料尚未寫入硬碟時即在記憶體內分析運算。Spark在記憶體內執行程式的運算速度能做到比Hadoop MapReduce的運算速度快上100倍，即便是執行程式於硬碟時，Spark也能快上10倍速度。Spark允許用戶將資料加載至叢集記憶體內存，並多次對其進行查詢，非常適合用於機器學習演算法。使用Spark需要搭配叢集管理員和分散式儲存系統。Spark支援獨立模式（本地Spark叢集）、Hadoop YARN或Apache Mesos的叢集管理。  在分散式儲存方面，Spark可以和HDFS、 Cassandra 、OpenStack Swift和Amazon S3等介面搭載。 Spark也支援偽分散式（pseudo-distributed）本地模式，不過通常只用於開發或測試時以本機檔案系統取代分散式儲存系統。在這樣的情況下，Spark僅在一台機器上使用每個CPU核心執行程序。在2014年有超過465位貢獻家投入Spark開發，讓其成為Apache軟體基金會以及巨量資料眾多開源專案中最為活躍的專案。</zh-speak>

      <speak>The Brook programming language and its implementation BrookGPU were an early and influential attempt to enable general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.Brook, developed at Stanford University graphics group, was a compiler and runtime implementation of a stream programming language targeting modern graphics hardware, to be used for program highly parallel GPUs such as those found on ATI or Nvidia graphics cards.BrookGPU compiled programs written using the Brook stream programming language, which is a variant of ANSI C. It could use OpenGL v1.3+, DirectX v9+ or AMD's Close to Metal for the computational backend and ran on both Microsoft Windows and Linux . It could also simulate a virtual graphics card by itself via a special CPU backend for debugging Brook purposes.</speak>

      <zh-speak>Xojo（读作“啁啾”）是一个跨平台编程语言及多平台开发工具，能为Windows、Mac OS X及Linux這三种操作系統编写具有图形用户界面的桌面（Desktop）程序、没有图形用户界面的控制台或后台服务程序、网络（Web）程序（有嵌入网络服务器功能的可独立运行版本以及支持Apache和IIS的CGI两种方式），并即将支持iOS等移动平台。Xojo通过交叉编译在开发平台上为各种操作系統生成本机代码的原生的应用程序，即程序由CPU可以直接执行的指令组成，几乎所有界面控件也都是相应操作系統的原生界面控件。Xojo语言是完全面向对象（物件導向）的编程语言，支持继承、重构、多态，像Java和C#一样支持类接口（class interface）和命名空间（名称空间，namespace）。除此之外，还有委托（delegate）、反射/自省（introspection）等现代编程语言所具有的功能。Xojo语言是强类型语言，所有变量需要先定义后使用。Xojo的集成开发环境（整合開發環境，IDE）提供了工程管理器、界面设计器、菜单设计器、工具栏设计器、报表设计器、代码编辑器、编译器、调试器等全套工具。Xojo的编译器曾经可以为X86、68K、PowerPC三大类芯片编译原生程序，随着后两者的衰落，目前只支持Intel X86系列及其兼容芯片，能为Windows生成PE格式可执行文件，为Mac OS X生成Mach-O格式程序包（以前还支持PEF格式的单一可执行文件），为Linux生成ELF格式的可执行文件。Xojo的编译器后端将在不久的将来采用LLVM代替自行编写的编译器，从而能为iOS和安卓等移动系统所支持的CPU编译原生应用程序。Xojo目前支持的操作系统程序库包括Microsoft Windows上的Win32及兼容API，Apple Mac OS X系统的Carbon框架和Cocoa框架，Linux上的GTK图形界面。以前还曾支持过Mac OS Classic平台，并且将会支持iOS的Cocoa Touch开发框架。Xojo提供插件（plugin）开发包SDK，使用户能将用C/C++等语言编写的程序库进行包装后在Xojo程序中调用。Xojo的Mac OS X程序还支持嵌入AppleScript脚本，所嵌入的脚本可以作为工程中的一个全局方法来调用，在Windows上则支持大部分ActiveX控件。Xojo语言通过与VB类似的Declare语句提供对操作系统API和各平台上的动态库、静态库文件中的函数进行直接调用。Xojo提供内嵌的SQLite数据库引擎，同时支持Oracle、MySQL社区版（MySQL的许可证不允许同时支持开源社区版和付费版的软件存在，因此目前仅支持社区版）、PostgreSQL、MS SQL Server（当然仅限Windows）等大部分主流的SQL数据库服务器，也支持以ODBC方式访问数据库。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>C++Builder 是一個用於在Windows平台上撰寫C++語言應用程式的快速化程式開發（RAD，Rapid Application Development）的整合開發環境（IDE，Integrated Development Environment），原係由Borland公司所開發銷售，現在此產品則歸屬於Embarcadero Technologies旗下的子公司Codegear。C++Builder把由Delphi開發出來的IDE和VCL（Visual Component Library）與C++編譯器結合。此系列產品的開發週期通常是先在Delphi上作重要的改進，然後再用到C++Builder上。在Delphi上所開發的主要元件通常無須修改就可以給C++Builder使用，但C++ Builder的元件卻不一定能給Delphi使用。C++Builder的開發環境中包含了所見即所得（WYSIWYG）的圖形使用者介面（GUI）設計工具，是最早導入簡易的、真正可以用拖拉方式進行軟體開發的程式設計工具之一。从它们的应用程序框架(Application Frame，有时也称为对象框架)进行比较。Visual C++采用的框架是MFC。MFC不仅仅是人们通常理解的一个类库。(同样，Delphi和C++Builder使用的VCL的概念也不仅仅是一个控件库。)你如果选择了MFC，也就选择了一种程序结构，一种编程风格。MFC早在Windows 3.x的时代就出现了，那时的Visual C++还是16位的。经过这些年的不断补充和完善，MFC已经十分成熟。但由于原型出现得比较早，MFC相比于VCL落后了一个时代。尽管微软对MFC的更新没有停止，我也经常读到持“只要Windows不过时，MFC就不会过时”之类观点的文章，但就象Inprise(原Borland)的OWL框架的淡出一样，MFC的淡出也是早晚的事。如果MFC青春永驻，微软的开发人员也不会“私自”开发出基于ATL的WTL呀。当然，WTL的地位不能和MFC比，它并不是微软官方支持的框架，封装的功能也相当有限。但至少也反衬出了MFC存在的不足。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>蓝灯（Lantern） 是一个免费的针对互联网审查的对等网络（P2P）代理软件。它提供了一种用户可信赖的节点绕过互联网封锁，但它不同于匿名软件Tor。该软件可以使自由上网国家的用户可以分享带宽帮助互联网审查国家的用户。 因此蓝灯使用分布式连接，不会过分强调单个连接或节点。蓝灯的CEO和首席开发者亚当·菲斯克（Adam Fisk）, 是LimeWire和LittleShoot的前首席工程师。蓝灯的注册和使用需要读取Gmail和Google Talk的一些内容，并且还获得了美国能源部国家种子资金的资助。这引起了用户对于隐私的忧虑。 即使菲斯克表示政府的资金资助并不能代表此软件不安全。早在2013年12月初，短短两个星期内，蓝灯的中国用户激增到上万。因此不久后，该网络几乎被中国政府中断。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>Ophcrack是一個使用Rainbow table來破解視窗作業系統下的LAN Manager雜湊（en:LM hash）的程式，它是基於GPL下發佈的開放原始碼程式。它接受不同格式的雜湊，包括視窗作業系統的SAM檔案。使用作者免費提供的Rainbow Table，可以在短至幾秒內破解最多14個英文字母的密碼，有99.9%的成功率。包含更多字母（包括符號和空格）的Rainbow Table可以在Objectif Securité購買。從2.3版開始可以破解NT雜湊，這功能對已經關閉LAN Manager雜湊的系統（Windows Vista的預設設定）或是長於14個字母的密碼特別有用。它另有一個自生系統的版本，可以自動破解視窗作業系統的密碼。安裝在Windows的版本需要系統管理員資格才可正確運行。Ophcrack還提供啟動系統的光碟（LiveCD），以Linux為基礎。只需以光碟啟動電腦，Ophcrack便會自動運行，破解和譯出帳號密碼。Ophcrack啟動系統光碟現時最新版本為3.6.0。</zh-speak>

Pat Coady, the younger brother of Irish quarterback alums Tom and Ed Coady, was instrumental in reviving the program in 1892, recruiting a completely new squad of players, and becoming the de facto team captain.The new team played two games in the 1892 season, destroying South Bend High School 56-0, and then rallying from a 4-6 halftime deficit to tie Hillsdale College at 10-all.Following graduation, Coady settled in Paris, Illinois where he married Helen Hennessy on September 2, 1902.

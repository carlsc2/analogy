      <speak>FreeBSD is a free Unix-like operating system descended from Research Unix via the Berkeley Software Distribution . Although for legal reasons FreeBSD cannot use the Unix trademark, it is a direct descendant of BSD, which was historically also called "BSD Unix" or "Berkeley Unix". The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993, and today FreeBSD is the most widely used open-source BSD distribution, accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed systems running open-source BSD derivatives.FreeBSD has similarities with Linux, with two major differences in scope and licensing: FreeBSD maintains a complete operating system, i.e. the project delivers kernel, device drivers, userland utilities and documentation, as opposed to Linux delivering a kernel and drivers only and relying on third-parties for system software; and FreeBSD source code is generally released under a permissive BSD license as opposed to the copyleft GPL.The FreeBSD project includes a security team overseeing all software shipped in the base distribution.</speak>

      <zh-speak>金屬蕊（Metalcore）是一個金屬樂的子類型，結合了極端金屬與硬蕊龐克。金屬蕊這個詞大約是在1990年代中期出現，由極端金屬的「金屬」與硬蕊的「蕊」組成，而這些類型樂團有Earth Crisis、Deadguy、Integrity。這些早期的樂團，像是Integrity，最早在1988年表演，當時玩這類型的樂團有終極殺戮樂團（Killswitch Engage）、叛客魔咒樂團（Underoath）、All That Remains、 混種魔獸樂團（Trivium）、As I Lay Dying、致命情人樂團（Bullet for My Valentine）與The Devil Wears Prada。金屬蕊和其他融合龐克金屬的音樂，不同之處在於：他更強調Breakdown。Breakdown是一種較緩慢，節奏卻強烈的曲段，通常會使聽者做「衝撞」（Mosh Pit）的動作。在過去的五年中，衝撞這個動作已經由樂團Sepultura立為金屬蕊表演中不成文的傳統。關於衝撞，他則是一種在舞台前方，對空氣拳打腳踢、觀眾互相碰撞的動作。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>《俠盜獵車手V》（英语：Grand Theft Auto V）是一款開放世界動作冒險遊戲，由Rockstar North製作，Rockstar Games發行。本作在2013年9月17日於PlayStation 3和Xbox 360主機上推出。這是《俠盜獵車手》系列中第15款作品，也是繼2008年的《俠盜獵車手IV》後第一款主要續作。由於本作是第七世代遊戲機末期推出的大型作品之一，因此在上市前便獲得了廣大的期待。《俠盜獵車手V》是在開放世界環境中以第三人稱、第一人稱遊玩，可讓玩者自由的與遊戲世界互動。遊戲背景設定在虛構的美國聖安地列斯州（San Andreas，以南加州為範本），玩者可隨意地在鄉間和虛構的城市洛聖都（Los Santos，以洛杉磯為範本）中漫遊。本作單人模式中有三位主角，玩者可在三人之間自由切換操控，而故事劇情則以三人策劃並執行六次大型搶劫行動。遊戲中也包含了線上多人模式，名為俠盜獵車手Online，已於同年10月1日開放，最多可容納16位玩家(PS4,Xbox One及PC版最多可容納30位玩家)在遊戲世界中互相競爭或合作。開發商將《俠盜獵車手V》視為能延續該公司過往多款作品精神的遊戲，例如《碧血狂殺》和《江湖本色3》。本作的開發在《俠盜獵車手IV》推出後隨即展開，主要著重在系列遊戲核心架構上的創新，提供三名主角讓玩者操控。《俠盜獵車手V》一推出就獲得許多評論的讚賞，特別是針對遊戲的故事劇情、表現手法和開放自由的遊玩方式。《俠盜獵車手V》也在商業上獲得極大成功，上市後24小時之內就創下突破遊戲業界紀錄的8億美金銷售額，三天內總銷售額達到10億美元，成為歷史上銷售速度最快的娛樂性產品。Rockstar Games曾暗示將發布至其他平台，并于2014年索尼的E3游戏展前发布会上宣布本作将在2014年秋季登陆PlayStation 4遊戲平台；并在稍后公布了也将登陆Xbox One，最後是集結所有技術的PC版本，也因為在新平台開發，電腦隨著主機因素順延後又因為技術問題二度跳票，遊戲上市比起前一部作品慢了一年之久。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>Planking，中文有趴街、仆街、鋪板等譯名，為網路上流行文化，在諸種場所（尤以不尋常的地方），伸直身體俯趴於目標物上後，拍照分享於網路。「planking」活動於1997年由Gary Clarkson和Christian Langdon所創，起初於英國北部流行。在2011年受台灣網友關注後，獲大中華地區民眾的留意。2011年，planking熱潮流竄於社群網站，台灣玩家挪用粵語詞彙「仆街」譯之；香港媒體則是翻作「趴街」(香港明報)、「鋪板」(香港蘋果日報)。2011年5月15日，澳洲一名男子因玩planking從7樓墮地身亡，是趴街活動的第一個死亡者。2011年台灣陸委會宣傳台灣觀光廣告影片《這三年來，台灣不一樣了》，以少女在阿里山、太魯閣、總統府、六合夜市、九份老街扮成屍體直挺挺躺在路邊，賴幸媛稱讚仆街可成為台灣深度觀光的最佳代言，結果被香港媒體（如《明報》）認為無創意又低級的宣傳，因為仆街在廣東話是詛咒人橫屍街頭的意思。此外，「趴街」所帶來的意味，令其在一些惡搞文化中佔有一定位置，例如《蒙面超人X》泰文版主題曲，由於部分歌詞發音的問題，於是其中一句被人以廣東話空耳成:「馬個屁股變菊花 趴街」。</zh-speak>

It has been described as a genre that adheres to an "aesthetic of failure," where the deliberate use of glitch-based audio media, and other sonic artifacts, is a central concern.Sources of glitch sound material are usually malfunctioning or abused audio recording devices or digital electronics, such as CD skipping, electric hum, digital or analog distortion, bit rate reduction, hardware noise, software bugs, crashes, vinyl record hiss or scratches and system errors.In a Computer Music Journal article published in 2000, composer and writer Kim Cascone classifies glitch as a subgenre of electronica, and used the term post-digital to describe the glitch aesthetic.</speak>

      <speak>Bonk's Revenge  is a 2D platformer set in prehistory, originally for the TurboGrafx 16 console, created in 1991 by  the Red Company for Hudson and Turbo Technologies, and licensed by NEC. This is the second title in the Bonk series and it was re-released for the TurboGrafx-16 in 1992 on the Gate of Thunder 4-in-1 game CD-ROM. A completely different game with the same name appeared on the Game Boy, whereas the original version was re-released for Wii Virtual Console and on the Japanese PlayStation Store.</speak>

      <speak>ML is a general-purpose functional programming language developed by Robin Milner and others in the early 1970s at the University of Edinburgh, whose syntax is inspired by ISWIM. Historically, ML stands for metalanguage: it was conceived to develop proof tactics in the LCF theorem prover . It is known for its use of the Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm, which can automatically infer the types of most expressions without requiring explicit type annotations.</speak>

      <speak>Digital Equipment Corporation, also known as DEC and using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1960s to the 1990s. It was a leading vendor of computer systems, including computers, software, and peripherals, and its PDP and successor VAX products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales.From 1957 until 1992 its headquarters were located in a former wool mill in Maynard, Massachusetts . DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq, which subsequently merged with Hewlett-Packard in May 2002. Some parts of DEC, notably the compiler business and the Hudson, Massachusetts facility, were sold to Intel.Digital Equipment Corporation should not be confused with the unrelated companies Digital Research, Inc or Western Digital, although the latter once manufactured the LSI-11 chipsets used in DEC's low end PDP-11/03 computers.</speak>

Prior to version 4.4, released in February 2010, the Software Compilation was known as KDE, which stood for K Desktop Environment until November 2009.

      <speak>Mac OS is a series of graphical user interface–based operating systems developed by Apple Inc. for their Macintosh line of computer systems.The original operating system was first introduced in 1984 as being integral to the original Macintosh, and referred to as the "System". Referred to by its major revision starting with "System 6" and "System 7", Apple rebranded version 7.6 as "Mac OS" as part of their Macintosh clone program in 1996. The Macintosh, specifically its system software, is credited with having popularized the early graphical user interface concept.There have been two operating systems popularly known as "Mac OS". Up to major revision 9, from 1984 to 2000, it is historically known as Classic Mac OS.  Major revision 10, from 2001 to present, is branded OS X . Major revisions to the Macintosh OS are now issued as point revisions, such that, for example, 10.2 is substantially different from 10.5. Both operating systems share a general interface design, and there has been some overlap of application frameworks  for compatibility; but the two systems have different origins and use deeply different architectures.</speak>

Keyhole's marquee application suite, Earth Viewer, emerged as the highly successful Google Earth application in 2005; other aspects of core technology survive in Google Maps, Google Mobile and the Keyhole Markup Language.The name "Keyhole" is also a homage to the KH reconnaissance satellites, the original eye-in-the-sky military reconnaissance system now some 50 years old.</speak>

      <speak>English Americans, also referred to as Anglo-Americans, are Americans whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in England, a constituent country of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.According to the American Community Survey in 2010 data, Americans reporting English ancestry made up an estimated 9.0% of the total U.S. population, and form the third largest European ancestry group after German Americans and Irish Americans.However, demographers regard this as a serious undercount, as the index of inconsistency is high, and many, if not most, people from English stock have a tendency  settlers who colonized Ireland during the Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century.In 1982, an opinion poll showed respondents a card listing a number of ethnic groups and asked, "Thinking both of what they have contributed to this country and have gotten from this country, for each one tell me whether you think, on balance, they've been a good or a bad thing for this country." The English were the top ethnic group with 66% saying they were a good thing for the United States, followed by the Irish at 62%.The overwhelming majority of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America were of English extraction, including Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, John Adams, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.English immigrants in the 19th century, as with other groups, sought economic prosperity.</speak>

      <zh-speak>美国共有59处人称国家公园的保护区，由内政部下属的国家公园管理局运作。国家公园需经国会立法建立。1872年，总统尤利西斯·辛普森·格兰特签署法案，设立第一个国家公园：黄石国家公园，之后又于1875年设立麦基诺国家公园（于1895年取消国家公园地位），再于1890年设立岩溪公园（之后并入首都公园）、美洲杉国家公园和优胜美地国家公园。1916年，国会通过管理构成法建立国家公园管理局，“来保护自然风光、历史遗迹及其中的野生动植物，为人们提供休闲享受，同时保持它们不受损伤，留给子孙后代。”许多国家公园在国会立法设立前都经总统根据古迹法划为国家纪念区保护。7个国家公园配有国家保护区（其中6个在阿拉斯加州）。虽然国家公园和国家保护区都是一起管理，但两者分属不同的单位，下方表格中的国家公园面积也不会包括保护区的面积。2013年设立的尖顶国家公园是美国最年轻的国家公园。国家公园的入选标准包括自然风光、独特的地质地貌、不同寻常的生态系统和人们在此娱乐休闲的可行性（不过并非所有标准都会同时考虑）。与之相比，国家纪念区通常会根据历史或考古学方面的意义来选择景点。全美有27个州、以及美属萨摩亚和美属维尔京群岛拥有国家公园。这其中加利福尼亚州以9个居首，阿拉斯加州以8个紧随其后，接下来分别是犹他州（5个）和科罗拉多州（4个）。阿拉斯加州的朗格－圣伊利亚斯国家公园占地面积超过3.2万平方公里，大于美国面积最小的9个州，也是最大的国家公园，面积排第2至第4的国家公园同样位于阿拉斯加州。阿肯色州的温泉国家公园占地面积不足24平方公里，是最小的国家公园。所有国家公园的面积总和约有21万平方公里，平均每个3620平方公里，不过中位数只有1280平方公里。根据2014年的统计数据，位于北卡罗莱纳州和田纳西州境内的大烟山国家公园是造访人数最多的国家公园，这年有超过1000万游客到访，其次是游客人数超过470万的亚利桑那州大峡谷国家公园。与之相比，位置偏远的阿拉斯加州北极门国家公园同年仅接待游客1.2万人。截至2014年，美国已有14个国家公园入选世界遗产。以下表格中列出美国现有的国家公园。对于已经取消的国家公园，或是属于美国国家公园管理局管理的其他类型保护区不会列入下表。</zh-speak>

      <speak>The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930.

      <zh-speak>世界盃足球賽（官方名稱：FIFA World Cup）是由國際足球總會（FIFA）於1930年成立的一項足球比賽，每4年舉行一次，除了1942年和1946年的賽事因第二次世界大戰而取消外，其餘賽事都照常舉行。上屆的世界盃足球賽於2014年在巴西舉行，決賽結果德國加時以1：0擊敗阿根廷，獲得第四次冠軍。決賽是歷屆世界盃足球賽的最後一場比賽，獲勝隊伍即為當屆世界盃冠軍。一般決賽時間為90分鐘，如戰平則進行30分鐘的加時賽，若依然平局则進行互射十二碼來分出最终勝負。歷屆世界盃決賽大多採用單敗淘汰制來進行，除了1950年世界盃足球賽，因為这屆是世界盃史上唯一采用小组循环赛制的決賽，由該屆赛事四个小组的第一名（巴西、西班牙、瑞典和乌拉圭）相互比赛3场。其中巴西對烏拉圭的賽事（當屆最後舉行的兩場賽事之一）中，烏拉圭戰勝巴西，使他們在決賽組積分反超前巴西而成為冠軍，因此國際足協視之為當屆事實上的決賽。賽事舉辦至今，共有77支球隊曾進入世界盃決賽週。77隊之中，只有12支曾打入決賽，8支球隊奪冠（其中6支是首度打入決賽即奪冠）。迄今为止，世界杯历史上最成功的球隊是巴西，共获得过5次冠軍；義大利和德國均获得过4次冠軍；阿根廷和烏拉圭各获得过2次冠軍；法國、英格兰和西班牙則各获得过1次冠軍。</zh-speak>

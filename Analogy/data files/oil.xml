      <zh-speak>聚光太陽能熱發電（或稱聚焦型太陽能熱發電，英语：Concentrated solar power， 縮寫：CSP）是一個集熱式的太陽能發電廠的發電系統。它使用反射鏡或透鏡，利用光學原理將大面積的陽光匯聚到一個相對細小的集光區中，令太陽能集中，在發電機上的集光區受太陽光照射而溫度上升，由光熱轉換原理令太陽能換化為熱能，熱能通過熱機（通常是蒸汽渦輪發動機）做功驅動發電機，從而產生的電力。聚光太陽能熱發電（CSP）已被廣泛的商業化，並且從2007年至2010年年底，CSP市場已經出現了約740 MW的發電能力的增加。在2010年，超過一半的發電能力（約478 MW）已被安裝，使其全球總發電能力達到1095 MW。西班牙在2010年增加了400 MW，以總的632 MW領先了全球，而美國截至同一年年底增加了78 MW，達到了總發電能力爲509 MW，其中包括兩個化石燃料-CSP混合的發電廠。 中東也提升他們的安裝基於CSP項目的計劃，並作為該計劃的一部分，世界上最大的CSP項目Shams-I已被馬斯達爾（MASDAR）安裝在阿布扎比市。。CSP不會受到雲層干擾，其供電時間為用電高峰，許多CSP可以使用熔鹽儲熱，因此在沒有日照後數小時仍會發電，儲熱量也不需太高，在深夜及凌晨可以停止發電，但此時用電量較低（使用基載電力就可滿足），這樣的CSP就已經很實用，在非高峰時間，CSP的發電量可以依需求調節（可以在短時間內停止發電、此時聚集的熱量會完全儲存於熔鹽內），彈性甚至比天然氣發電還要高。CSP預計將以快速的步伐繼續增長。截至2011年4月，在西班牙建設另外946MW的容量，使新容量總計為1,789MW，預計到2013年底前投入營運。在美國有進一步的1.5GW的拋物線槽式和發電塔式發電廠正在建設中，并還有簽訂了至少6.2GW的合同。在北非和中東地區，以及印度和中國也存在顯著的興趣。全球市場一直被拋物線槽式發電廠佔據著，佔了90％的CSP發電廠。CSP不要与聚光光伏（CPV）混為一談。聚光光伏（CPV）是通過光生伏打效應（photovoltaic effect）把聚光的太陽光直接轉換為電能。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>太陽光電系統，也稱為光生伏特，简称光伏（Photovoltaics；字源“photo-”光，“voltaics”伏特），是指利用光伏半导体材料的光生伏打效应而将太阳能转化为直流电能的设施。光伏设施的核心是太阳能电池板。目前，用来发电的半导体材料主要有：单晶硅、多晶硅、非晶硅及碲化镉等。由于近年来各国都在积极推动可再生能源的应用，光伏产业的发展十分迅速。截至2010年，太阳能光伏在全世界上百个国家投入使用。虽然其发电容量仍只占人类用电总量的很小一部分，不过，从2004年开始，接入电网的光伏发电量以年均60%的速度增长。到2009年，总发电容量已经达到21GW，是当前发展速度最快的能源。据估计，没有联入电网的光伏系统，目前的容量也约有3至4GW。光伏系统可以大规模安装在地表上成为光伏电站，也可以置于建筑物的房顶或外墙上，形成光伏建筑一体化。自太阳能电池问世以来，使用材料、技术上的不断进步，以及制造产业的发展成熟，都驱使光伏系统的价格变得更加便宜。不仅如此，许多国家投入大量研发经费推进光伏的转换效率，给与制造企业财政补贴。更重要的，上网电价补贴政策以及可再生能源比例标准等政策极大地促进了光伏在各国的广泛应用。</zh-speak>

In 2012, the Algerian economy grew by 2.5%, up slightly from 2.4% in 2011. Excluding hydrocarbons, growth has been estimated at 5.8%  due to the continuation of the expansionary fiscal policy initiated in 2011 to meet strong social demands in terms of purchasing power, jobs and housing.</speak>

      <speak>Post-Britpop is a subgenre of British alternative rock, made up of bands that emerged from the late 1990s and early 2000s in the aftermath of Britpop, influenced by acts like Pulp, Oasis and Blur, but with less overtly British concerns in their lyrics and making more use of American rock and indie influences, as well as experimental music.</speak>
      <zh-speak>後英式搖滾（英语：Post-Britpop）是英式另类摇滚下的一種音樂類型。此類型的音樂在英伦摇滚沒落後崛起，並成為21世紀的主流音樂之一。這些樂團受到了果漿樂團、绿洲乐队和布勒等樂團的啟發，但相較於英倫搖滾，他們的歌詞較少強調英國國內的觀點，反而融入了美式搖滾、独立摇滚和實驗音樂的元素。电台司令和神韻合唱團等樂團在英倫搖滾尚未衰退之前就已獲得了些許成功，但在退潮之後才開始成為英國音樂的主流。隨著時間的演進，愈來愈多樂團參與後英式搖滾的行列，例如特拉维斯、立體音響樂隊和飼養員等樂團。其中，酷玩樂團相較於先於他們的後英式搖滾樂團，在國際上獲得了更大的成功，甚至進而成為2000年代初最成功的樂團之一。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Baroque pop, baroque rock, or English baroque, often used interchangeably with chamber pop/rock, is a pop rock music subgenre that originated in the United States and United Kingdom.</speak>
      <zh-speak>巴洛克流行（英语：Baroque pop）、巴洛克摇滚或英格兰巴洛克是一个流行搖滾的子类型，于1960年代诞生于美国和英国，融合了流行摇滚、古典音乐、管弦乐流行和巴洛克音乐。该流派在1960年代晚期达到巅峰，常规性地创作这种音乐的乐队有：披头士乐队、海滩男孩、滚石乐队、普洛柯哈伦等。1970年代，巴洛克流行渐渐失去主流影响力，一部分原因是朋克搖滾、迪斯科和硬摇滚的风靡。在古典音乐领域，巴洛克音乐指约1600年至1750年间欧洲的艺术音乐，著名的作曲家为巴赫与维瓦尔第等。巴洛克流行不如同时期的摇滚乐狂野奔放，商业化程度较低，更严肃成熟。它采用在流行乐中少见的乐器如弦乐器、圆号、大鍵琴、風琴等。常见的元素也包括多层旋律、突出的和声与精巧的制作。和同样采用管弦乐编曲的前卫摇滚相比，巴洛克流行总体来说歌曲结构较简单，接近标准流行乐；歌词也更主流，不像晚期的前卫摇滚大多有抽象的歌词。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes, though it was later repurposed to refer to a series of late 1980s British alternative rock bands that drew from earlier influences to create a more ambient but still melodic form of pop music.</speak>
      <zh-speak>太空摇滚是摇滚乐的一个分支，这个词原本是指20世纪70年代早期，主要是英国的一些前卫和迷幻摇滚乐队，如Hawkwind的和Pink Floyd，缓慢冗长的器乐段落、占主导地位的电子乐器、合成器，吉他实验作品和科幻或天文主题是它的风格，尽管它后来被用于形容一系列20世纪80年代末英国另类摇滚乐队，这些乐队受早期太空摇滚的影响，创造一种更加氛围话、但仍然旋律优美的流行音乐形式。这个词在21世纪复兴了，代表乐队有The Flowers of Hell、Comets on Fire、Flotation Toy Warning和God Is an Astronaut等。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>Group Sounds（或 Group Sound）是日本1960年代後半期以結他為主、由數人組成的搖滾樂隊種類，簡稱 GS。自1966年披頭四到日本公演以後，一邊唱演唱一邊親自演奏電吉他等樂器的樂隊在日本不斷冒起，以年輕讀者為主的藝能雜誌《週刊明星》把這些樂隊和音樂通稱為「Group Sounds」或「Group Sound」，及後被廣泛使用。1960年代末期，GS的熱潮急速減退，踏入新搖滾音樂年代，部份GS樂隊也開始解散，而The Spiders、The Tigers和The Tempters解散後，部份成員於1971年組成日本首個超級組合「PYG」。現在，一般提及的Group Sounds都是指1960年代後半期活躍於咖啡店的流行曲樂隊和搖滾樂隊。另外，樂隊以和製英語命名都是GS的特色。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&amp;B or RnB, is a genre of popular African-American music that originated in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, insistent beat" was becoming more popular.In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, saxophone, and sometimes background vocalists.</speak>

      <zh-speak>流行搖滾（Pop rock）是Pop音樂與搖滾樂的混合音樂，特色是使用平易近人的流行風格、明亮歌詞以及吉他為基礎的歌曲。流行搖滾有著許多不同的定義，從「樂觀的搖滾音樂」到「Pop音樂的一個分支」。學者認為流行樂和搖滾樂常處於相反立場：流行樂的反對者常稱流行樂為華而不實的商業產品，而搖滾樂的擁護者則主張搖滾樂是真實、真心、反商業的音樂。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Raga rock is rock or pop music with a heavy Indian influence, either in its construction, its timbre, or its use of instrumentation, such as the sitar and tabla.</speak>
      <zh-speak>拉格摇滚（英语：Raga rock）是指受印度音乐重度影响的一种摇滚或流行音乐，体现在结构、音色和乐器使用上，比如使用锡塔琴和塔布拉鼓。近来的学者把1960到70年代结合南亚音乐的英国摇滚乐也包含在内。 通常，拉格摇滚不被视为一个具体的音乐流派，而是对受印度傳統音樂影响的摇滚乐的笼统描述。尽管这样的音乐在1960年代之后也有出现，但印度影响主要体现在1960年代的摇滚乐中，因此该名称大多指限于那个年代的摇滚乐。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>笛是一種管樂器，是屬於无簧片的木管樂器，由通過樂器開口的空氣來發聲。依照霍恩博斯特爾-薩克斯分類法，笛屬於边棱音气鸣乐器（edge-blown aerophones）。常見的笛為直身長管，除了吹奏用的吹口外，還有幾個調整音高的開口，各開口的打開或閉合會產生不同的音高。各地方有不同的笛，有些笛（如直笛）是豎笛，吹口在笛的末端，吹奏時笛和嘴唇垂直。有些笛（如長笛）是橫笛，吹口在笛的側面，吹奏時笛和嘴唇平行。笛是除了人聲之外最古老的樂器，在考古研究中，發現最早的笛是用動物的尺骨鋸去兩端關節鑽孔而成的骨笛，在德國施瓦本阿尔比發現許多舊石器時代笛，距今約43000年至35000前，這些笛子表示了當時歐洲的人類已有演奏樂器的傳統。而中國也有發現距今約9000年至7700年的賈湖骨笛。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the doom metal, speed metal, thrash metal, black metal, and death metal genres.Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal.</speak>

      <speak>Post-punk is a type of rock music  that paralleled and emerged from the punk rock movement of the 1970s. The term refers to music that derives inspiration from the musical energy, ideological provocation, and DIY stance of punk while moving beyond its particular musical characteristics, cultural affiliations, and thematic constraints.Though spanning various styles and sensibilities, common affinities among post-punk artists included experimentation with production techniques and non-rock musical styles such as funk, dub, electronic, disco, and avant-garde music, the appropriation of ideas from modernist art, literature, politics, and theory into musical contexts,  and the rejection of aesthetics perceived of as traditional, hegemonic, or rock-oriented in favor of novel sonic and visual innovations.</speak>

      <zh-speak>後搖滾（Post-rock）在分类上尚有争议，有些人将其看作摇滚乐的一种。后摇的一个特点是，所用乐器一般与摇滚乐相同，但节奏、和声、旋律、音色及和弦进行（Chord progression）都有别于传统摇滚。後搖滾於1980年中期，在歐美音樂界開始被提出。在後搖滾音樂裡，許多常見的音樂產業傳統現象都被顛覆改寫，例如吉他不再是主要角色；沒有歌詞或主唱；打破傳統歌曲長度，有些樂曲甚至長達二、三十分鐘，後搖滾甚至想打破唱片工業創造一首膾炙人口單曲的願望。后摇滚体现了很多流派的特点，比如氛围音乐、爵士、电子（electronica）和实验音乐。后摇中人声很少见，且当有人声的时候，它也不是像传统的那样作为主旋律并且有清晰的歌词，而更像一种乐器。在后摇中，人声多为很轻柔的哼唱，不规律地分布在整首歌中。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Shoegazing  is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged from the United Kingdom in the late 1980s and reached peak popularity in the early 1990s. The term "shoegazing" was initially devised by the British music press as a gibe meant to ridicule the stage presence of groups of the period, who stood still during live performances in a detached, introspective, non-confrontational state, often with their heads down; the heavy use of effects pedals also contributed to the image of performers looking down at their feet during concerts.</speak>
      <zh-speak>瞪鞋搖滾（中國大陸一般譯作盯鞋搖滾）或低頭搖滾、自賞搖滾（英语：Shoegazing，或簡短的Shoegaze），是一種另類搖滾支派，出現於1980年代晚期的英國，並於1990年及1991年達到顛峰。英國音樂刊物——特別是NME與Melody Maker——將此風格命名為「瞪鞋搖滾」，是因為這些樂團在現場演出時經常站著不動，全神貫注於在地上的效果器，貌似盯著他們的鞋子一樣。瞪鞋搖滾常在音樂中玩弄吉他效果，加上不清楚的聲線旋律，融入吉他富有創意的噪音背景中。人們將瞪鞋搖滾與倫敦其他相關樂團形容是「自賞」或「自娛」。1990年代，瞪鞋搖滾樂團被美國的油漬搖滾風潮蓋過，進而促使相對較不知名的瞪鞋搖滾樂團解散或改換其他樂風。</zh-speak>

Kane等乐队最先开始尝试融合后朋克、苦中带甜的流行乐旋律和仙音元素（ethereal wave，暗潮音乐的亚流派），形成梦幻般的“音景”。梦幻流行流派更多地注重音乐的质地和情感，而不是传统摇滚乐常有的推进性的反复乐节。 主唱的声音常为气音甚至近乎耳语，歌词往往是关注内心的。专辑封面往往糅合了模糊的、柔和的图像风格和极简的设计风格。4AD唱片公司是与梦幻流行相关的最著名的公司，其他厂牌如 Creation、Projekt、Fontana、Bedazzled、Vernon Yard和Slumberland在该流派上也相当有影响力。梦幻流行依靠音速处理音乐质地来表达悦耳的音调，尝试使用气声和充满回音的吉他效果和电子合成器来加以处理效果。尽管极地双子星通过他们模糊的声音和颓靡的音景常被看作是梦幻流行的领导者，但是这个流派在形式上还有比缓慢电子结构更为多的的差异。在中国也有该风格的艺人。王菲在98年的《唱游》中就做了大量的气声化处理，营造出一种梦幻飘渺的境界，这和王菲欣赏极地双子星并与其在96年的《浮躁》中的合作是密不可分的，而《唱游》也获得了世界十佳DREAM POP专辑。</zh-speak>

      <speak>New wave music is a musical genre of pop/rock created in the late-1970s to mid-1980s with ties to 1970s punk rock.</speak>
      <zh-speak>新浪潮（英语：New Wave）音乐是摇滚乐的一种分支风格，与朋克摇滚一同在1970年代中晚期出现。起初，新浪潮被认为是朋克摇滚的同义词。由于新浪潮结合了电子乐，实验音乐，摩斯族次文化，迪斯科，摇滚和1960年代的流行音乐等音乐风格的特性，使它与朋克摇滚区别开来。 在某一时期，后朋克摇滚乐也曾被定义为新浪潮音乐，但是逐渐地，新浪潮的流行偏向使它与更注重纯粹艺术性的后朋克分道扬镳。新浪潮吸收了很多原本朋克摇滚的声音与特质，例如简短以及具有强劲节奏的歌曲，同时在音乐表现与歌词方面具有更多的复杂性。 除此之外，合成器的大量使用，后期制作的应用和艺术表现的多样性也是新浪潮音乐的特色。 总体来说，新浪潮是一种多变且有时让人感觉古怪的音乐，常常伴有吸引人的旋律线，不少歌曲朗朗上口且易于流行。新浪潮艺人的创作灵感常常来自对多种音乐风格的融汇与吸收，例如1950至60年代摇滚复兴，斯卡与雷鬼音乐，以及舞曲等。新浪潮音乐在1980年代取得了巨大的成功，并成为80年代的主流音乐风格之一，期间活跃着不少具有影响力的新浪潮音乐艺人与乐队。 此外，新浪潮音乐人在MTV频道的较高出镜率也对该风格的流行起到了推波助澜的作用。新浪潮音乐在80年代中期逐渐开始丧失其主导性地位，虽然在1990年代和2000年代有过几次复兴，但是影响力仍日趋衰落。新浪潮音乐的新一轮复兴在2004年开始流行起来，并启发和影响了独立摇滚等音乐风格。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>Trip hop（又称trip-hop，中文也译作“神游舞曲”、“吹泡音乐”）是一种缓拍电子音乐流派，起源于20世纪90年代的英国，尤其是英国布里斯托。Trip hop衍生自post acid house，最先是被英国音乐媒体和记者用以形容一种更具实验性的、深受靈魂樂、放克和爵士乐影响的碎拍节奏（breakbeat）音乐，被形容为“20世纪90年代后半期欧洲音乐的又一选择”，“融合了嘻哈和电子音乐，而两者最终都消融其中”。提起Trip hop，便不得不提缓拍Downtempo。尽管身为电子音乐的一员，Trip hop的节奏却不像传统电子音乐那样快，而且鼓点节奏更灵活多变，节奏型有很多后半拍和副点，配合迷离的女声，给人以一种迷离的、迷幻的体验。 Trip hop音乐融合了多种风格，而且和其他流派多有共通之处，例如，它和氛围音乐（ambient music）便有不少相似之处。与嘻哈类似的是，Trip hop有着鲜明的节奏鼓点，同时又混合了浩室音乐、電子舞曲、R&amp;B和dub 雷鬼（dub reggae）音乐的元素。从本质上说，Trip hop极具实验性。Trip Hop有三个代表人物，皆来自英国布里斯托，分别是Massive Attack乐队、Tricky以及Portishead乐队，人称“Trip Hop”三巨头、铁三角。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>另类嘻哈 (又被称作另类说唱) 是一种嘻哈音乐形式，对其定义众说纷纭。 Allmusic给出的定义如下:说唱音乐有其固有形式，例如匪帮说唱、迈阿密贝斯、硬核说唱以及聚会说唱，而另类嘻哈则不遵从这些传统形式。其流派模糊——包含乡土爵士乐、流行音乐/摇滚乐、爵士乐、灵魂乐和雷鬼音乐。另类嘻哈发源于1980年代晚期，在1990年代早期达到鼎盛。该音乐形式主要由东海岸的音乐团体引领，例如The Roots, De La Soul、Jungle Brothers以及A Tribe Called Quest，与当时诸如The Pharcyde和Jurassic 5的西海岸嘻哈形成互补。但是，音乐家们时常发现自己在与新出现并不断发展壮大的西海岸匪帮说唱乐竞争中挣扎。这种状况随着1990年代中期以武当帮乐团（Wu-Tang Clan）、纳斯和声名狼藉先生（The Notorious B.I.G.）为代表的东海岸硬核说唱乐的快速发展并成为主流而改变。随着这种发展趋势，许多另类嘻哈乐队或是解散，或是式微。但是在1990年代晚期到20世纪早期又出现了复苏迹象，部分是由于通过互联网传播音乐的大量运用。斯蒂芬·罗迪克（Stephen Rodrick）将Arrested Development、Basehead和The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy视为是另类嘻哈的代表。 Arrested Development与The Fugees是最初为数不多的几个被主流观众认可的说唱团体。就是年代中期开始，像洛克斯名廠（Rawkus Records）、Rhymesayers、anticon.、Definitive Jux等厂牌通过包装Atmosphere乐团、Black Star乐团、Pharoahe Monch、Mos Def、aesop rock以及3OH!3等另类嘻哈音乐人，同样赢得了主流认可。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Electronic dance music , EDM is generally used in the context of a live mix, where a DJ creates a seamless selection of tracks by segueing from one recording to the next.The term "electronic dance music" and the initialism "EDM" was adopted by the U.S. music industry and music press as a buzzword to describe the increasingly commercial American electronic music scene that developed in the late 2000s. In this context, EDM does not refer to a specific genre, but serves as an umbrella term for several commercially-popular genres, including house, trance, dubstep, trap, and their respective subgenres.</speak>
      <zh-speak>電子舞曲是一種主要為了在夜店或其他與舞蹈相關的娛樂活動中播放所製作的電子音樂。此類型的音樂大多是為了讓DJ（disc jockeys，中文又稱唱片騎師）於連續播放的「DJ set」中使用而創作，在DJ set中，DJ會使用混音等技巧讓不同歌曲或唱片之間能夠滑順的銜接起來。電子舞曲是一個廣義的名詞，用來描述各種以迪斯可、浩室、鐵克諾（techno）和嘻哈為骨幹製作的混合性音樂類型。電子音樂是在1980年代從各地的夜店誕生並開始流行，其後經歷了1980年代後期的倉庫派對場景，以及之後的銳舞和迷幻浩室（acid house）風潮。到了1990年代中期，電子舞曲已經大量的出現在當代文化中，其在社會中的角色也開始在各種歷史、文化和社會科學的研究文獻中被分析探討。電子舞曲是利用各種如合成器、擊鼓機和音序器等電子樂器所創造，並刻意強調這些樂器的獨特聲音效果，有些電子樂器也會模仿傳統共鳴樂器的聲音。電子舞曲有時也包括以舞曲風格為創作基礎，但並非是完全為了使用於舞蹈中所製作的音樂。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>放克（魂克）是一種美國的音樂類型，起源於1960年代中期至晚期，非裔美國人音樂家將靈魂樂、靈魂爵士樂和節奏藍調融合成一種有節奏的、適合跳舞的音樂新形式。放克「不再強調旋律與和聲，而強調電貝斯與鼓的強烈節奏律動」。放克歌曲通常建立在單一和弦上的衍伸性即席伴奏，不同於節奏藍調和靈魂樂圍繞在和弦進行（chord progression）。放克采用的和弦扩展形式与鲍勃爵士一样，例如，将小三和弦扩展为七和弦、十一和弦，或在属七和弦上转位到九和弦。 如同其他受非洲音乐影响的音乐，放克通常具有一种借助电吉他、电贝斯、电子琴以及爵士鼓作伴奏而成的复杂的舞动感。放克音樂家们有时还会加入由萨克斯风、小号和长号演奏的“管乐部分”，以便加强乐曲的节奏“冲击感”。放克音乐形成于1960年代， 詹姆士•布朗创作了一个典型的强调第一拍的节奏群，即在任何时候开始打拍子都强调第一个重拍，无论是放克的低音线条、爵士鼓点还是吉他的切分音节等。后来，其它乐队也逐渐采用了 詹姆士•布朗创作的节奏和演唱风格，放克音乐也更加兴盛。到了1970年，Sly &amp; the Family Stone的一曲《Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)》和1971年的《Family Affair》登上音乐榜首位。尽管放克音乐的历史主要由男性书写，但放克从不缺少才华横溢的知名女性音乐人，如Chaka Khan, Labelle, Brides of Funkenstein, Klymaxx, Mother's Finest, 和 Betty Davis等。放克风格的音樂家也会演奏迪斯科和灵歌，而放克音乐的小样也被广泛地使用在嘻哈音乐、浩室音乐和敲打贝斯中。放克的衍生流派包括放克摇滚（如Red Hot Chili Peppers）、布吉摇摆（boogie）（又称为电子放克，是电子音乐的一种，是电子音乐与放克的结合版）、放克金属（如Living Colour）、G-funk（匪帮说唱与放克的结合）、廷巴（一种放克古巴流行舞曲）和放克即兴爵士（如Phish）等。许多音乐类型，如说唱、家庭音乐和鼓打贝斯等，都有放克元素。同时，go-go风格作为放克音乐的子类别的一种，受到了较大放克音乐影响。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Screamo  is a subgenre of hardcore punk that evolved in the early 1990s. This initially involved a more aggressive offshoot of emo music and used short songs that grafted "intensity to willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics." Screamo has been described as a dissonant style of emo influenced by hardcore punk using screaming vocals.</speak>
      <zh-speak>Screamo（为了与Emo区分而有译作嚎叫情绪）是一種硬蕊龐克（Hardcore punk）的子類型，大多承襲於Emo這種音樂類型，與其他在1990年代的音樂。「Screamo」這個詞源先是用在1991年發展於美國聖地牙哥一些比較激進的Emo樂團，他們利用曲長較短的創作，結合抽搐般的強度來刻意實驗出不和諧與力度變化。說起Screamo就不得不提到Emo，雖然大多數Screamo樂隊很反感外界對他們的身世探究，而且一直可以在音樂和感情上與Emo保持著相當的距離。但是，他們無法消除Emo在他們的音樂中烙下的“胎記”，以至於他們永遠無法擺脫令他們深惡痛絕的卑賤血統和“私生子”身份。1984年，華盛頓的地下搖滾樂圈浮現出了一支背離傳統曲風的朋克/硬核樂隊《春天的祭禮》（Rites of spring），樂隊主唱ROS以極度情緒化的歌詞，在歌曲中暴露著個人化的情感和十分危險的情緒，這種帶有明顯攻擊性的音樂風格和令人肝腸寸斷、撕心裂肺的情緒化表演方式，以及歌曲中傳遞出的痛苦甚至扭曲的脆弱敏感情緒，給聽著帶來了一種前所未有的觸動。可以說“春天的祭禮”是第一支真正意義上的Emo樂隊。Emo的音樂風格上很接近流行朋克，但是遠比流行朋克復雜；歌詞內容非常個人化，像意識流的抒情詩或者是自我的懺悔。即使EMO音樂缺少一些陽剛之氣但是繼承了硬核音樂追求真實和抵製商業文化的精神。90年代後期，美國青年對純粹的硬核音樂的熱情逐漸衰退，取而代之的是趨近商業的流行朋克和新金屬，Emo也開始在自己的音樂中融入清晰明亮的吉他或者鍵盤的即興回复段落，更加強調音樂的旋律的悅耳動聽，而這種符合潮流的音樂最終取悅的注定是主流市場。於是，幾經濃妝粉飾的Emo音樂，終於登堂入室，成為了討巧的另類主流音樂，成為流行媒體的新寵。Emo開始變得無處不在，搖滾樂壇似乎也被這幫粗暴兇惡的外表隱藏著溫吞血液和脆弱情感的「披著羊皮的狼」們所主導。任何一種新興文化形式的出現直至作為一種大眾文化存在下去，必將招致人們對它存在的意義和價值質疑，更何況他是以一種妥協的姿態存在著，這將招來更多的非議。一些樂評諷刺的說:Emo最為顯著的特徵就是“清脆響亮的吉他來復加上哭哭啼啼的歌詞”。樂迷則更加不留情面的將Emo批評為“軟核”（Softcore）或者「雌性激素氾濫的朋克樂」。而那些拒絕妥協的樂手們對抗主流文化的方式則是最為直接、最為現實也更為行之有效，那就是做出更為暴戾、更為吵鬧的「噪音核」（Noisecore Emo），或者索性從傳統Emo音樂的戚戚哀哀中徹底抽身出來，創作出​​更具破壞性，更具爆發性和挑釁性，也更真實、誠懇的音樂。當時很多樂手吸收了80年代哥倫比亞州的朋克/情緒樂隊如：Fugazi以及《春天的祭禮》等樂隊的音樂中傳遞的社會和政治方面的信息和態度，產生了一批結合了金屬的音色和硬核的價值觀而詞作上更為激烈、尖銳和痛苦的樂隊，包括Earth Crisis、Neurosis以及Cave In等。他們激發了更多的音樂人打破金屬和硬核的界限，推進這兩種音樂的共同發展。無論創作初衷如何，他們的行動直接促成了日後的Screamo音樂的產生。同早期的硬核朋克一樣，Screamo也出現於美國的東北部和東海岸。源自Emo的Screamo雖然帶有明顯的Emo痕跡，但是它的音樂的攻擊性和侵略性較Emo要凶狠的多。這類音樂中充斥著硬核急速嘯叫的吉他，但音樂旋律較為流暢，而歌手則已充滿挑戰的尖叫，聲嘶力竭的呼喊出鬱結心頭的苦痛苦和憤懣，這種音樂不但具有朋克和硬核的特質，並且由於樂手來自不同的音樂陣營，以及對各種音樂風格成分龐雜的汲取，以至於他們的音樂又帶有深重的金屬特點。鑑於風格源頭，Screamo還是要分兩派。一個是更偏向朋克，比如:Thursday、Taking Back Sunday、The Used、Underoath等；另一派則是更偏向於金屬，如：Atreyu、Poison The Well、Story of the year、Funeral for a friend等。 Screamo在音樂態度、審美觀和價值觀上雖然沒有傳統硬核那樣蠻橫，但比起鼻涕眼淚的Emo卻已經足夠生猛、凶悍了，歌曲詞作涉及的題材也遠比EMO單純反應自殺、女人和自身苦痛經歷的創作主題要開闊許多，死亡、毀滅、絕望、痛苦和混亂成為了他們音樂共同的主題。作為Screamo重要特徵的尖聲叫喊的演唱方式，在搖滾史上已經由來已久。現在在一些硬搖滾樂隊，特別是死亡金屬的一些分支流派，更是在演唱中融入呼喊、咆哮。搖滾史上最著名的尖叫聲也許應該首推The Who的主唱Roger在樂隊1971年的經典歌曲《Won't get fooled again》中的原始嚎叫。但樂迷對這種駭人的叫聲卻情有獨鍾：“在聽鄉村歌曲中的時候，你會期待帶著碩大牛仔帽的歌手在他們的演唱中插入岳得爾調，Screamo歌手為什麼就不能用血脈噴張的嘶吼來表達情緒。當然那些Screamo樂手也不是僅僅憑藉尖叫聲掩蓋創作能力的匱乏，正好相反，他們有著超乎其他搖滾樂手的才能。他們在歌曲中用明了而機警的詩句表達著年輕一代的悲哀和焦慮。在他們的音樂中流淌著美妙的旋律，音樂的風格也表現出於他們年齡不符的成熟與睿智。另外，樂手驚世駭俗的颱風也是Screamo的一大特色。 Jonathan Dee在他發表於2003年6月29日《紐約時報》的文章《The Summer of Screamo》中這樣描述The Used的主唱Bert McCracke的演出現場：“與其說他是在表演不如說是在舉行向歌迷獻身的宗教儀式。他傾盡了自己的感情和精力，不停的地跳躍、狂跑，最後縱身躍入台下高舉雙手的人群中，宛如一場獻身的祭禮。”這樣的感情宣洩，這樣表達親密與純潔的冒險方式在主流音樂中是罕見的。Screamo樂隊和他們的硬核、EMO前輩一樣，在早期是長期處理地下狀態的，只能在一些獨立地下廠牌DIY一些七寸唱片。很不辛，當時很多Screamo樂隊同早期的EMO樂隊一樣短命，通常只發行一兩張七寸唱片後就銷聲匿跡了，這種狀態持續了很多年，大大限制了Screamo作為一種新生搖滾樂流派的發展。近年，網絡的傳播和銷售在很大程度上幫助了Screamo的流傳。樂迷們通過eBay，在網上交換或是出售他們收藏的一些樂隊早期作品的稀有版本，甚至是絕版唱片。這些拷貝在網上被叫買到令人瞠目結舌的價格，而這些唱片在最初發行的時候最多買到十美元。Screamo的漸趨流行於當下美國青少年厭倦了被動跟隨主流文化，厭倦了老套的資本主義價值觀不無關聯。 “人們希望能夠形成自己對事物的看法，他們希望他們聽到的歌是寫給他們自己的。”Atreyu的主唱Alex Varkatzas說。的確對於很多人來講，Screamo太過於粗野，製作也過於粗糙，很難得到主流的肯定和商業上的成功。但是事實證明，在當前靜如死水，走勢低迷的搖滾市場，他們已經取得了廣大樂迷和主流媒體的認可。更客觀的是，他們的樂迷分別來自曾經老死不相來往的朋克和金屬兩大陣營。這種壯觀的景像只在十幾年前Grunge大潮興起時間出現過。這種外界的認可正是來自他們穿做態度的誠懇，和他們音樂內容的真誠。隨著Screamo的走紅，“Screamo”作為一頂時髦的帽子，被蘭扣在了其他任何一支EMO，後朋或者受EMO影響的硬核樂隊頭上。很多樂隊勉為其難不清不白頂著Screamo這頂帽子，但是從某種意義上說，這並不完全是一件壞事，憑藉著頂帽子，他們才得到主流的垂青，得到了大唱片公司的一紙合同。他們的成功也為後來更多的同類型樂隊進軍提供借鑒，鋪平了道路。上前年Screamo已經成為一種主流的音樂形式，樂隊進入主流金屬雜誌和使無數樂隊揚名的MTV2 Headbanger's Ball節目頻道。前年OZZFEST（奧茲音樂節）更像鯊魚修道血腥味一樣對Screamo做出了反應，它的第二舞台就是用來做各種新式重型音樂的演練場————1998年時的“體制崩潰“，1999年的Slipknot,以及2002年的The Used，去年大膽地邀請來一幫嚎叫著青春的年輕樂隊：Atreyu、Every Time I Die、Unearth、Hatebreed以及Throwdown等。 Screamo顯然已殺入了嚴肅的重型音樂圈。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Techno  is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word techno in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built.In Detroit techno resulted from the melding of African American music including Chicago house, funk, electro, and electric jazz with electronic music by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder, and Yellow Magic Orchestra.</speak>
      <zh-speak>鐵克諾音樂（英语：Techno music），又譯「高科技舞曲」，是一種電子音樂，發源於80年代中期到晚期的密西根州底特律市。在1988年，「鐵克諾」一詞首度被用作標示音樂類型，而如今舞池上各種鐵克諾曲風五花八門，族繁不及備載，然而底特律鐵克諾（Detroit techno）仍被視為所有分支曲風的基底。鐵克諾的成形始於兩種音樂的融合：來自白人的歐陸電音子音樂，例如Kraftwerk，以及放克（funk）、electro、芝加哥浩室（Chicago house）與電聲爵士等美國黑人音樂；除此之外，與美國晚期資本主義社會相關，充滿未來感的科幻主題也對鐵可諾影響深遠，尤其是艾文·托佛勒 （Alvin Toffler）的著作《第三波》（The Third Wave）。鐵克諾製作人始祖胡安·阿特金斯（Juan Atkins）曾說過，他之所以用「鐵克諾」來形容自己所創造的音樂風格，就是受到托佛勒發明的詞彙「鐵克諾叛客」（"techno rebels"）啟發所致；基於以上獨特影響元素，人們會將鐵克諾納入一種稱黑人未來派主義（afrofuturism）的美學概念。對德里克·梅（Derrick May）等製作人來說，將靈魂從肉身移轉至機械，是他們的中心思想，一種科技靈魂的表現；從這角度切入，「鐵克諾舞曲擊潰了狄奧多·阿多諾（Theodor Adorno）所認為機械化對現代意識造成的疏離效果」。</zh-speak>

Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s.

Pentangle's album from that same year, Basket of Light, too, exhibited a certain degree of folk jazz experimentation, amidst other releases from that time, the majority of which were not as commercially successful.</speak>

      <zh-speak>日本音樂所稱之「歌謠曲」，指的是日本流行音樂的一個種類。但根據情況的不同，有幾個不同的意義被使用，大概有以下諸些定義。 廣義上，指的是日本整體流行音樂當中，有歌詞者。 狹義上，從上述分類中，更加鎖定受搖滾（ロック）、民謠（フォーク）、爵士（ジャズ）、fusion（フュージョン）等歐美流行音樂影響較稀薄者，「歌詞」上的著重其實指的是音樂風格。具體來說，在現在，演歌或者是心情歌謠，即帶有戰前伊始的昭和 20 年歌謠曲，乃至具古典色彩的歌曲、歐美進口的流行音樂的轉錄製品（Cover version）等，故有相當寬廣的範疇。常被認為是演歌的古賀旋律（古賀メロディー），也是因為早期鑽研曼陀鈴吉他音樂，使得其西洋樂風的曲子也多。 最狹義的歌謠曲指的是，進一步將演歌等除外，介於演歌和流行歌曲（ポップス）之間的大眾音樂才稱呼為歌謠曲。 有時則包含歐洲等的外國流行音樂，亦即受爵士樂或搖滾樂影響較少的舊時代音樂，這些也稱為歌謠曲。廣義上，凡有日本歌詞的流行音樂（演歌、J-POP都算）大部分也包含在內。而且「J-POP」等用詞流傳之後，1990年代以降，「歌謠曲」一詞變得不太常被使用。歌謠曲在日本樂界80年代由中森明菜引領至巔峰，但是中森明菜因為男友近藤真彥與第三者松田聖子的接吻照曝光，造成1989年的中森明菜自殺未遂事件。隨著此次事件，象徵著中森明菜時代的過去，在日本樂界上也以[歌謠曲崩壞]為這時代做下註解。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>凯尔特音乐（英文：Celtic music）是一个被艺术家、唱片公司、音像店和音乐杂志用来描述一种宽泛的音乐类型的名词，这些音乐类型均自西欧凯尔特人的民间音乐传统发展而成。就概念本身而言，没有任何真正的音乐主体可以被精确地描述为凯尔特音乐，但这个名称依然被确定下来，既指口头传播的传统音乐，也包含被录制下来的流行音乐。而后者有时与相关于某种凯尔特文化的民间音乐勉强仅有一些表面的相似之处；但另一方面，它有时也代表那些为使凯尔特传统更适合于现代世界文化所做的真诚付出。 凯尔特音乐主要意味两方面的内容：首先，它是那些自称凯尔特人的音乐（一个无关音乐的，最初的国家定义），以此相对于“法国音乐”或“英国音乐”；其次，它包含每一种能使音乐作品具有独特性的凯尔特民族的元素。一些人坚持认为外表不同的凯尔特音乐作品实际上也无任何共同之处，例如Geoff Wallis和Sue Wilson在他们共同著有的《爱尔兰音乐简要指南》（The Rough Guide to Irish Music）中的观点，而有些人（如Alan stivell）则说有。 通常，凯尔特音乐这个名称用来指爱尔兰和苏格兰音乐，因为这两个地方都产生了闻名于世的与众不同的音乐风格，而这兩种风格实际上有着名副其实的共同特征和明显的相互影响。但值得注意的是，爱尔兰和苏格兰的传统音乐人自己却回避使用“凯尔特音乐”这个名称，除非迫于市场的需要。他们的音乐形式被世人所知是因为爱尔兰人和苏格兰人在英语世界的重要作用，尤其在美国，这种作用给美国音乐带来了意义深远的冲击，特别是蓝草和乡村音乐。威尔士、康沃尔、马恩岛、布列塔尼、加利西亚、坎塔布里亚和阿斯图里亚及葡萄牙北部的音乐也被认为是凯尔特音乐。布列塔尼的传统格外强烈，在那里，大小凯尔特节会贯穿全年。在威尔士，古老的诗歌音乐比赛年会仍然存在。另外，海外的凯尔特人文化群体的音乐作品也充满生气，特别是在加拿大和美国。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>酸爵士（英语：Acid Jazz），又譯迷幻爵士（見#名稱段落），源於英國英格蘭南部，是爵士樂的一種分支音樂類型，結合了部分靈魂樂、放克音樂（Funk）和的士高成分，尤其是循環拍子和調式和聲方面。它在1980年-1990年間開始發展，由最初類似爵士放克（Jazz-funk）風格，轉型至類似電子舞曲和波普音樂的混合。吉爾斯·彼得森（Gilles Peterson）和埃迪·皮爾勒（Eddie Piller）也成立了一家同樣名為「酸爵士」（Acid Jazz Record，簡稱 Acid Jazz）的英國唱片公司，旗下歌手皆會唱酸爵士音樂。唱片公司願意專為酸爵士出唱片，可見它很受歡迎（見右圖）。酸爵士包含很多電子音樂元素，而且很適合作現場即興改版演出，所以歌手都很喜歡在其演唱會演唱酸爵士歌曲。英格蘭樂隊「匿名者」（Incognito）和「新重騎兵」（Brand New Heavies）的演唱尤其著重酸爵士的和弦特質。酸爵士的發展也可算作爵士放克、靈魂爵士的復興。因為多種樂器可作現場即興演出，加上酸爵士特殊的編曲模式，讓唱片騎師的「刮擦」技術得以體現 ─ 這協助諾曼·傑伊（Norman Jay）、吉爾斯·彼得森、帕特里克·福奇（Patrick Forge）等唱片騎師打響知名度。酸爵士的常用樂器包括：色士風、小號、长号、單簧管、鋼琴、結他、低音提琴、鼓。（詳見「常用樂器」段落）</zh-speak>

      <speak>Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that developed in the early 1930s and became a distinctive style by 1940. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophones and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a "lilting" swing time rhythm.</speak>
      <zh-speak>搖擺樂（英语：Swing music）是1930年代早期發源於美國的一種音樂類型，至1935年已形成獨特的風格。搖擺樂依靠由低音大提琴和鼓組成的節奏組來支撐旋律組(旋律組包含小喇叭、伸縮喇叭等銅管樂器、薩克斯風、單簧管等木管樂器，有時也會加入小提琴、吉他等弦樂器。)節拍速度大致多為中等至輕快，帶有搖擺的節奏感。音樂之所以稱為「搖擺樂」，是由於音樂強調小節裡的下半拍或弱拍，因而帶來搖擺的感覺。搖擺樂樂團通常會有獨奏樂手為編制好的音樂加上即興演奏。1935年至1945年稱為「搖擺年代」(Swing Era)，在各大樂團以及古德曼(Benny Goodman)等樂團領班的演奏下，可供跳舞的搖擺樂稱霸當時的美國流行樂壇。</zh-speak>

      <speak>Oi! is a subgenre of punk rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The music and its associated subculture had the goal of bringing together punks, skinheads and other working class youth.The Oi! movement was partly a response to the perception that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, in the words of The Business guitarist Steve Kent, "trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic...and losing touch". André Schlesinger, singer of The Press, said, "Oi shares many similarities with folk music, besides its often simple musical structure; quaint in some respects and crude in others, not to mention brutally honest, it usually tells a story based in truth." For instance, "Such Fun", from Oi! Oi! That's Yer Lot! by The Blood, is an extension of the 1977 Sex Pistols song "God Save the Queen", which attacks the abuse of power by those who hold themselves in a royal or religious majesty.</speak>

      <zh-speak>金屬蕊（Metalcore）是一個金屬樂的子類型，結合了極端金屬與硬蕊龐克。金屬蕊這個詞大約是在1990年代中期出現，由極端金屬的「金屬」與硬蕊的「蕊」組成，而這些類型樂團有Earth Crisis、Deadguy、Integrity。這些早期的樂團，像是Integrity，最早在1988年表演，當時玩這類型的樂團有終極殺戮樂團（Killswitch Engage）、叛客魔咒樂團（Underoath）、All That Remains、 混種魔獸樂團（Trivium）、As I Lay Dying、致命情人樂團（Bullet for My Valentine）與The Devil Wears Prada。金屬蕊和其他融合龐克金屬的音樂，不同之處在於：他更強調Breakdown。Breakdown是一種較緩慢，節奏卻強烈的曲段，通常會使聽者做「衝撞」（Mosh Pit）的動作。在過去的五年中，衝撞這個動作已經由樂團Sepultura立為金屬蕊表演中不成文的傳統。關於衝撞，他則是一種在舞台前方，對空氣拳打腳踢、觀眾互相碰撞的動作。</zh-speak>

      <speak>The New Wave of American Heavy Metal is a heavy metal music movement that originated in the United States during the early to mid-1990s and expanded most in the early to mid 2000s. Some of the bands considered part of the movement had formed as early as the late 1980s, but did not become influential or reach popular standing until the following decade.</speak>
      <zh-speak>美式金屬新浪潮（New Wave of American Heavy Metal，常縮寫為 NWOAHM 或是 NWoAHM）是起源於美國90年代後期的一種重金屬運動。這名稱是參考自1980年代的英國重金屬新浪潮。 雖然這名詞常被搖滾媒體使用，但是其定義尚未非常明確。 有些人認為美式金屬新浪潮將重金屬音樂重新帶回主流市場。</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>電鋼琴是一種電氣樂器，外形和鋼琴類似。與使用合成器的電子鋼琴的不同在於它使用機械發聲，再經由拾音器轉化成電信號，發聲原理和電結他類似，都是以類比信號直接輸出到電鋼琴專用的樂器放大器或輸出到錄音設備，而非像鋼琴般以其木箱外殼來直接共鳴發聲。和鋼琴類似的地方是，其木造琴鍵牽動鋼琴內部包着絨氈的小木槌，這結構是一模一樣的；繼而敲擊鋼絲弦發出振動，這個運作原理都是相同的。不同的地方是，並不是以箱體的的振動發聲，而是運用了電磁學原理，由每條琴弦對應的每粒拾音器來感應並收集每條琴弦的振動。當琴弦振動時，切割了拾音器的磁感線，從而使拾音器接上的導線中產生不同頻率的電流，當這些電流通過電子音箱還原時，就成了電鋼琴的聲音。隨著電鋼琴的發展及音樂風格演化的需要，後來有很多電鋼琴已經由原本的鋼琴弦換成了金屬片作為振動體，以令音色有更多變化及滿足曲風的需求，如Rhodes Piano、Wurlitzer EP-200A等等。但亦有不少電鋼琴至今仍保留使用鋼琴弦，如Yamaha的CP-70 Electric Grand Piano、Electra Piano等等。 電鋼琴的例子： Rhodes Piano 芬達樂器公司 MKI MKII MK7 Mr. Ray Hohner的Cembalet Clavinet Pianet Electra Piano Wurlitzer EP-200A 山葉株式會社（Yamaha）的 CP-70 Electric Grand Piano</zh-speak>

      <zh-speak>拉格（英文：Raga, 亦稱作 raag, raaga, ragam)，簡單來說是印度古典音樂旋律所用的調式，但這個字直譯為「色彩」、「色相」，亦可以解作「美」、「旋律」。拉格由四個或以上的音高組成，而利用拉格可以構成不同的旋律。但拉格不僅是調式，也同時也決定每個音是怎樣演繹，每個拉格有獨特的感情和氣氛。傳統上，拉格會在特定的季節和時間演奏。而除了北印度古典音樂和南印度古典音樂，印度的電影及流行音樂亦常常會應用拉格。鹿特丹音樂學院的學者 Joep Bor 將拉格形容為「有調性的框架，用以作曲及即興演奏」。美國加州大學洛杉磯分校的民族音樂學者 Nazir Jairazbhoy 認為拉格的特性是：音階、上行和下行的走勢、省略的音、強調的音和音區、每個音的音準(是否略高或略低)以及裝飾的手法。</zh-speak>
